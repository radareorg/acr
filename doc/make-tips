Makefiles suggestions
=====================

Always get the environment variables from ACR:

CC=@CC@
PREFIX=@PREFIX@
VPATH=@VPATH@
INSTALL_PROGRAM=@INSTALL_PROGRAM@

Start writing the makefile from the template created with 'acr -m' may be
a good idea.



Conditionals:
=============

For GNU make:

ifeq ($(HAVE_SDL_MIXER),1)
LDFLAGS+=-lSDL_mixer
endif

For BSD make

.if ${HAVE_SDL_MIXER} == "1"
LDFLAGS+=-lSDL_mixer
.endif


This is so tricky and system dependent...you can use ACR to fix this:

IF HAVE_SDL_MIXER LDFLAGS += -lSDL_mixer ;

But remember, this LDFLAGS will be world-wide, and may be interesting to
use different LDFLAGS for each program or directory src:

= GAME_LDFLAGS ;
IF HAVE_SDL_MIXER GAME_LDFLAGS += -lSDL_mixer ;
